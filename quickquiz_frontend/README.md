# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify
## Backend API Connectivity (IMPORTANT)

To connect the QuickQuiz frontend to the backend API, you must set the correct backend address via environment variables.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in this folder.
2. Set `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` to the URL where your backend is running (e.g., for local dev: `http://localhost:8000`). If deploying remotely (cloud/preview): set it to the public endpoint of your backend.
3. Optionally set `REACT_APP_WS_URL` if your websocket uses a different address (usually `ws://[host]/ws`).

If these are NOT set, the app tries to connect to `localhost:8000`, which will fail if the backend is not running locally in the same environment. Always ensure these are set to the accessible backend location.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
